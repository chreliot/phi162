<p>Choose one of the following, numbered topic-options, below. Focusing on what it asks for, write at least 1200 words. (Adding in response to questions: There is no upper limit for how many words you write, but there is also not any expectation that you will write much more than the minimum.) Each of the topics has two parts, marked “a” and “b.” They are intended to be thought of as equally important, so devote at least 40% of your writing to each of those two parts. Note that, as the Writing handout says, your analysis should   use brief, focused quotations as evidence; it should “cite short passages from the assigned texts to support your analysis—to show the reader that what you say is being said really is being said.”</p>
<p>See the <a href="WritingAPhilosophyPaper-2021.pdf">Writing a Philosophy Paper</a> handout for general guidelines.</p>

<li>
<p>In Chapter 3 of <em>Origin of Species</em>, Charles Darwin describes “the struggle for existence.” The struggle for existence, as he describes it, is not one activity, but many different things.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. What are the different forms it takes, as he describes them in Chapter 3?</li>
<li>b. In light of the diversity of kinds of struggles for existence you described, do modern humans struggle for existence in some, all, or none of these ways? Why or why not? (The more general issue this points to is to what extent human beings are now subject to evolutionary pressures.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In his article on adaptation, Richard Lewontin argues against what he calls “the adaptationist program.”</p>
<ul>
<li>a. What is the adaptationist program, as Lewontin describes it? Pick your own example of a trait of some organism you think is interesting — a trait that Lewontin does not discuss. How might the adaptationist program analyze it?</li>
<li>b. How does Lewontin argue against the adaptationist program? (Does he think its assumptions are false, or the reasoning behind it is mistaken, or something else?) Using your imagination, how might someone committed to the adaptationist program respond to Lewontin&rsquo;s argument?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timothy Shanahan argues that evolutionary progress is possible, at least in a constrained sort of way.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Shanahan and Richard Lewontin each describe some arguments against the possibility that evolution results in progress of living things. What seem to you to be the main arguments, and what is their reasoning?</li>
<li>b. How does Shanahan, building on Richard Dawkins, defend a limited sort of evolutionary progress for living things, building on Darwin? If you were Lewontin or Stephen Jay Gould or another critic of the idea of evolutionary progress, how might you respond to Shanahan&rsquo;s argument for progress?</li>
</ul>
