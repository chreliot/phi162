<p>See the <a href="WritingAPhilosophyPaper-2021.pdf">Writing a Philosophy Paper</a> handout for general guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="procedure-and-format">Procedure and format</h2>
<p>In response to one of the two options under Content below, write at least 1400 words. Include your name only at the end of the last page of the paper, and submit your essay electronically through the course Blackboard site under the Assignments button, where the upload link will be marked “Assignment 2 — submit here.”</p>
<p>Write as if you&rsquo;re addressing someone who is not in the class and does not have a background in philosophy. Remember to support your attribution of ideas to authors with brief, focused quotations and page references. While you must acknowledge any sources you use other than course texts (see the Writing handout), this is not a research assignment per se, in that the only sources you need to draw on are those assigned in the course. That is, it requires no research beyond those.</p>
<p>Upload your essay by May 9 (or request additional time by email).</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<h2 id="option-one">Option one</h2>
<p>Think about how, based on ideas we&rsquo;ve discussed in the course, the world might be a little different than how most people normally think it is. That is, think of an assumption that many of us hold that is challenged by a reading in the course—whether or not you think that challenge was successful in the end.</p>
<p>Write an essay beginning with “So, you think the way things are is that <em>X</em>?” where <em>X</em> is a belief you think a lot of people probably hold. Here&rsquo;s an example: “So, you think the way things are is that science can&rsquo;t tell us what&rsquo;s right and wrong?” I mean, write an opening sentence with exactly that structure, or alternatively write a different first sentence sentence that&rsquo;s still equivalent to it in meaning. Then, in the rest of the first paragraph, describe some reasoning that your interlocutor might believe supports the claim in question.</p>
<p>Then, in the remainder of the essay, develop and then evaluate an argument against this claim. In doing so, draw substantially on one text we looked at in the course after Darwin.</p>
<p>For this question, write in the second person (using “you”). (That is, ignore the usual rule against writing in the second person that&rsquo;s in the “Writing” handout.) Think about the project as if you&rsquo;re writing a newspaper editorial, for instance.</p>
<h2 id="option-two">Option two</h2>
<p>In this course, we’ve discussed a number of problems. “Problems” can mean various things, so to be clear I mean here something like &ldquo;puzzles.&rdquo; Specifically, I mean questions for which there seems more than one compelling answer. Think of a problem we discussed in the course that you think is interesting. Discuss why it is a problem, by identifying at least two, and up to three (if necessary), conflicting answers presented in course readings <em>Presenting reasons supporting answer</em>, to show what makes each one compelling. For source(s), use at least one reading assigned in the course after Darwin. Present the arguments — by which I mean those answers I mentioned, supported by reasons — in a concise way that makes clear why they are opposing. Finally, in the last 1/4 to 1/3 of your essay, suggest that one of the answers is better supported, by criticizing the support for the <em>other</em> answer. Since the support for that answer should take the form of assumptions + reasoning (or “premises” and “logic,” if you like), focus on one or both of those in your criticism.</p>
