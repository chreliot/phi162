      <description>Choose one of the following, numbered topic-options, below. Focusing on what it asks for, write at least 1200 words. (Adding in response to questions: There is no upper limit for how many words you write, but there is also not any expectation that you will write much more than the minimum.) Each of the topics has two parts, marked “a” and “b.” They are intended to be thought of as equally important, so devote at least 40% of your writing to each of those two parts.</description>
