      <description>See the Writing a Philosophy Paper handout for general guidelines.
Procedure and format In response to one of the two options under Content below, write at least 1400 words. Include your name only at the end of the last page of the paper, and submit your essay electronically through the course Blackboard site under the Assignments button, where the upload link will be marked “Assignment 2 — submit here.”

      <description>Choose one of the following, numbered topic-options, below. Focusing on what it asks for, write at least 1200 words. (Adding in response to questions: There is no upper limit for how many words you write, but there is also not any expectation that you will write much more than the minimum.) Each of the topics has two parts, marked “a” and “b.” They are intended to be thought of as equally important, so devote at least 40% of your writing to each of those two parts.</description>
