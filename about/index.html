<h1>About</h1>


<p>This site is for the PHI 161 Philosophy of Science course (Fall 2021) at Hofstra University.</p>
<p>In addition to this site, we will also use a Blackboard site. Blackboard is  available through the password-protected Hofstra Portal. Why use both? This site is easy to access and to publish to; the Blackboard site can present password-protected information. Material in copyright and grades will be available through Blackboard. There is a link to Blackboard at the top of this (and every) page ↑.</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-this-site">Structure of this site</h2>
<p>What you&rsquo;re responsible for each day is listed on the schedule on the  <a href="http://chreliot.github.io/phi162/">front page</a> by date. The schedule links to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Topics</strong> pages, normally spanning several class sessions. They list <strong>Required reading</strong> assignments, with details about how to find them, as well as further, <em>not-required</em> content you may be interested in under <strong>See also</strong>. <strong>Afternotes</strong>, if any, refer to follow-up items from class, things students send me, and similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong> pages describing tasks you have to complete and submit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tests</strong> pages gradually accumulating test questions for your first test (= “midterm exam”) and second test (= “final exam”). As there are two tests, there will be a list of possible questions for each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Resources</strong> page with other sources connected with the topics of this course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notes</strong> pages containing anything else I want to share with you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides finding what you need from the schedule, you can access lists of each of these kinds of content through the buttons at the top.</p>
<h2 id="share-things">Share things</h2>
<p>Think of anything that reminds you of what we&rsquo;re talking about in the course? Students sometimes send me things they think others might enjoy seeing. It&rsquo;s straightforward for me to add such things to the topics pages.</p>
