<p>Our second test, on Wednesday May 18, will be in our regular classroom, but at our registrar-assigned time, 10:30 AM. It will be designed to take at least an hour. You will have until 12:30 PM to finish it.</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>This test will cover the whole course, but with a strong emphasis on the second half.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main ideas for each of the readings and/or class presentations. On the test you will be asked to explain some ideas closely related to the answers of those Learning Questions, with some eye to integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Presented with a case, you should be able to analyze it using the frameworks we have discussed.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above. A small number of the questions might take some form like lists rather than paragraphs, but they will say so. You will get a blue book to write your answers in. Please bring what you need to write neatly. Pencils are fine.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed in terms of how well they reveal your <em>understanding</em> of the course material. Therefore, answers will need to be constructed as <em>explanations</em>, as if you&rsquo;re explaining to another student, to help the understand.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-questions">Actual test questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What does Wilson think the relationship between philosophical ethics and evolutionary biology should be?
What reasons does he offer in favor of that relationship?</li>
<li>What is one kind of relationship between ethics and evolutionary biology (from his list of four) that Kitcher argues is feasible? Why is it feasible?</li>
<li>What is one kind of relationship between ethics and evolutionary biology (from his list of four) that Kitcher argues is <em>not</em> feasible? Why is it not feasible?</li>
<li>How might one argue that the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma has implications for how ethics might have evolved?</li>
<li>How does Griffiths argue against one conception of what a sex is?</li>
<li>What is claimed, e.g., by Waters, to be a naïve way of interpreting causation in classical genetics that opens it up to criticism, and what is an alternative?</li>
<li>What position on sex is Richardson most concerned to argue against?</li>
<li>How, according to Richardson, could human biological material not, in some context, have a biological sex? What&rsquo;s an example?</li>
<li>What assumption about animal minds is common to Descartes and Davidson, and what is Davidson&rsquo;s argument for it?</li>
<li>What is one way an evolutionary argument might inform or answer the problem of other minds?</li>
<li>What is the mirror self-recognition test supposed to show, and what is a reason to think it might not show that?</li>
<li>What does the idea of disfunction have to do with the idea of statistical normalcy, and what is a problem with using the latter in defining “disease”?</li>
<li>Cooper argues that neither an evolutionary nor a biostatistical account can adequately define disease, so disease must be <em>what</em>? What is an objection to her account of disease?</li>
<li>What is Griffiths and Matthewson&rsquo;s (“GM,” if you like) account of disease, and what is one way of objecting to it?</li>
</ol>
