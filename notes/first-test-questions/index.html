<p>Our first test will take place during class on March 16.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="how-to-study">How to study</h2>
<p>To study for the test review and think about the answers to the Learning Questions for each of our units to date, and try to find the main arguments for each of the readings and/or class presentations. Think about integration among the topics — to how they might be understood as answer to the same, more general questions. Then work through the specific test questions listed below.</p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>The test will consist of six short, separate paragraphs you&rsquo;ll need to write in response to questions about the content above, during the class period. A small number of the questions might take some form like lists rather than paragraphs, but they will say so. You will get a blue book to write your answers in. Please bring what you need to write with neatly. Pencils are fine. Unless you have a medical issue, I will ask you to use the restroom before you start the test, not during the test.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your answers will be assessed (on a 0–4 point scale) in terms of how well they present an accurate understanding of the course material.</p>
<h2 id="actual-test-questions">Actual test questions</h2>
<p>The test will consist of some of the questions on this list. The questions selected for the test will appear on the test exactly as they are written here (subject only to correcting any typing/grammar errors). There will be at least eight of them on the test, of which you will need to choose six to answer.</p>
<p>For each question, write at least five sentences, and perhaps more. Try to answer the question in a way that someone not in the class could possibly understand. That is, try to concisely explain, towards displaying your understanding.</p>
<p><em>This list is complete.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>How does Aristotle explain the structure and form of living things, and what is an empiricist criticism of that theory?</li>
<li>What is the structure of the Great Chain of Being Smellie presents, and how does Darwin&rsquo;s theory undermine it?</li>
<li>What are a few ways evolution was understood to work by biologists who believed in evolution as a fact without believing in natural selection as a major cause of it?</li>
<li>What two theses can we understand \emph{Origin} as defending? Why, according to Waters, might Darwin have chosen to argue for them separately?</li>
<li>How does Malthus&rsquo;s economics give rise to Darwin&rsquo;s understanding of the struggle for existence?</li>
<li>What place in Darwin&rsquo;s argument in \emph{Origin of Species} do human projects to breed other animals for certain traits (like pigeon-fanciers do) have?</li>
<li>What is Darwin&rsquo;s example of the humble-bees supposed to demonstrate?</li>
<li>What challenges does Lewontin offer to conceiving of adaptation as problem-solving?</li>
<li>What is the Adaptationist Program, and what is one argument Lewontin levels against it?</li>
<li>What is a concern raised against an adaptationist approach to understanding human behavior, as exemplified, for example, by Wilson&rsquo;s Sociobiology?</li>
<li>Does Lewontin accept that adaptation is a real phenomenon? If so, when does he think scientists can identify traits as adaptations?</li>
<li>What argument against evolution being progressive does Gould offer?</li>
<li>What argument for evolution being progressive do Dawkins and Shanahan (building on him) offer?</li>
</ol>
